# AP Exam Updates

The College Board has modified the exams for all AP classes to allow home testing, you can find the [official word here](https://apcoronavirusupdates.collegeboard.org/students). The key points for us are:
* There will be no multiple choice section on the exams.
* The due date for the performance tasks has been pushed back to the **26th of May at 8:59 PM PDT**. Please note that the College Board list the deadline three hours later in Eastern Daylight Time – don't be fooled!
* The College Board is preparing "on demand" online classes (aka YouTube videos) to help you prepare for and complete the Explore and Create Performance Tasks.
